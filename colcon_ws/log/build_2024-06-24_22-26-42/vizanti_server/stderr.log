[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrosbridge_suite.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rosbridge_suite", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rosbridge_suite"
  with any of the following names:

    rosbridge_suiteConfig.cmake
    rosbridge_suite-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rosbridge_suite" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "rosbridge_suite_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "rosbridge_suite" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
